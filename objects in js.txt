                   Objects And Its Internal Representation In JavaScript
* Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
* objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively
* An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :
               Example:
                           let school = {
                              name : “Vivekananda School”,
                           location : “Delhi”,
                             established : “1971”    }
                     In the above example “name”, “location”, “established” are all “keys” and                                                                              "                    and "Vivekananda School”, “Delhi” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively.
* Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object. An object in JavaScript may also have a function as a member, in which case it will be known as a method of that object.
